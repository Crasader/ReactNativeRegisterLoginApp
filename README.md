### Disclaimer ###
This is my first attemp coding in React Native + Redux, also an attemp to acheive a correct folder project structure. If you want to use this as a base on any of your project I would be both flattered and scared at the same time.

I have not deployed it on real devices, I have been testing this on [EXPO XDE](https://expo.io/).
