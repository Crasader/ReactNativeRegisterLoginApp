# React Native Register/Login App
A simple React Native App for registering/logging in to a Laravel 5.4 app via API Passport (OAuth 2). 

## Motivation ##
I got "curious" with React Native + Redux.

## Dependecies ##
[axios]
[immutable]
[react-native-dotenv]
[react-navigation]
[react-redux]
[redux-thunk]

## Test Environment ##
[EXPO XDE](https://expo.io/).
[Android/IOS Simulator]

### Disclaimer ###
This is my first attemp coding in React Native + Redux, also an attemp to acheive a correct folder project structure. If you want to use this as a base on any of your project I would be both flattered and scared at the same time.
